This is an MSci physics project by a pair of physics undergraduates at Imperial College London. The aim of the project was to first implement the work done in 'paper', and then to apply this to some experimental data. Beyond this there were aims to provide dscan characterisation "in real time". There are also attempts being made to improve upon the speed and accuracy of the neural network used in the previously mentioned paper.
