a timeline of predictions

first set of predictions
------------------------

The prediction was very bad at this stage of the model. This was due to an issue with the input data pipeline. The inputs and outputs that the model was trained on were not aligned due to a problem in the ordering of tf.data.files .

        :alt: These predictions are much better and the result from the dnn follows the desired output for most of the frequencies.


###testing fit
